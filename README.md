# Game Arcade Prototype
# Overview
This project is a 2D arcade-style game developed using MakeCode Arcade. The game is designed with various interactive elements, including enemy spawns, power-ups, and dynamic 
level progression aimed to have an interactive and more enticing game structure by having different levels, challenges and mechanics.

# Features
- **Player Controls**: Move the player sprite freely and shoot projectiles.
- **Enemies**: Spawns enemies that follow the player and increase in speed and quantity with each level.
- **Power-Ups**: Includes unique power-ups like shields (protects the player) and grenades (destroys enemies in a radius).
- **Background Music and Sound Effects**: Adds immersion to gameplay with engaging sounds for actions like shooting, enemy destruction, and power-up activation.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShenghanZhang1/arcade-game-prototype.git

# Controls
- **Movement**: use arrow keys or on-screen controls to navigate the player sprite.
- **Shooting**: Press A button or the space bar button on the keyboard to shoot projectiles in the current direction.
- **Power-Up Activation**: power-ups are activated upon player contact with the respective power-up.

# Game Mechanics
- **Enemy Behavior**: Enemies track and follow the player, increasing in number and speed within each level.
**Power-Ups:**
- **Shield:** this grants temporary protection, destroying any enemies on contact.
- **Grenade:** acts as an area-of-effect attack, eliminating enemies within a radius.
- **Level Progression:** this increases difficulty by raising enemy speed and spawn rate as the playerâ€™s score advances.
